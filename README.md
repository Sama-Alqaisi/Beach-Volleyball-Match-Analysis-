# Beach Volleyball Match Analysis
# Introduction
The Beach Volleyball Match Analysis project focuses on analyzing key performance metrics in beach volleyball matches. This project leverages statistical analysis and interactive visualizations to uncover trends and insights into player performance, tournament dynamics, and factors such as attacks, digs, kills, blocks, and more. Built using R and R Studio, this project provides tools to dynamically explore data by player, year, gender, and rank. The repository includes the dataset, code, presentation, and a detailed report.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of real-world beach volleyball match data. It includes features such as:
- Player Statistics (Total Kills, Total Blocks, Serve Errors, Total Attacks)
- Match Details (Tournament Year, Gender, Player Age, Rank)
- Performance Categories (Top Performers, Mid-tier, Lower-ranked)
This dataset offers valuable insights into player and team performance across different tournaments and years, making it a rich source for analysis.

# Project Objectives
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, transform relevant columns, and categorize performance tiers based on player rankings.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends in player statistics, match frequency, and overall performance metrics.
- Interactive Visualizations: Create dynamic plots and dashboards using Shiny, Plotly, and ggplot2 to allow users to explore trends and player statistics over time.

# Core Components
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize player statistics such as total kills, blocks, digs, and more over different years.
Analyze trends by tournament year, player age, and rank.
- Interactive Dashboards:
Create interactive plots that allow users to select players and statistics, and visualize trends over time.
Use Shiny to build an interactive web app for exploring match data by player performance, gender, and rank.
#Result Analysis:
Analyze player performance trends, comparing top performers with mid-tier and lower-ranked players.

# Tools & Libraries Used
- R Studio: The main environment used for development.
- R: Programming language for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- Shiny: For building interactive dashboards.
- Plotly: For creating dynamic, interactive plots.
- ggplot2: For static and aesthetic visualizations.
- dplyr: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

# Documentation
The project includes:
- Dataset: Contains all the match and player data used for analysis.
- Code: R scripts and Shiny app for data analysis and interactive visualizations.
- Presentation: A summary of the findings and visualizations generated from the analysis.
- Report: A detailed report documenting the data preprocessing steps, analysis process, and results.
